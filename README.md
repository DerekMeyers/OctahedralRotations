# OctahedralRotations

This code allows the calculation of the rotation angles and A-site displacement vectors for both single-layer films and superlattices, currently limited to 1ABC_3/1DEF_3-type. For the superlattice, there are a separate set of rotations and atomic displacements for the individual layers. This is based upon the model established by Brahlek et al J. Appl. Phys. 121, 045303 (2017) from Steve May's group.
